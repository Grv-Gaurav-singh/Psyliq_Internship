# Diabetes Prediction using SQL

This project aims to predict diabetes using patient data through SQL queries. The dataset contains various attributes related to patients' health, such as age, gender, BMI, blood glucose levels, hypertension, diabetes status, heart disease, smoking history, and HbA1c levels.

## Project Tasks

1. **Retrieve Patient ID and Ages**
2. **Select Female Patients Older than 40**
3. **Calculate Average BMI of Patients**
4. **List Patients in Descending Order of Blood Glucose Levels**
5. **Find Patients with Hypertension and Diabetes**
6. **Determine the Number of Patients with Heart Disease**
7. **Group Patients by Smoking History and Count Smokers and Non-Smokers**
8. **Retrieve Patient IDs of Patients with BMI Greater than Average**
9. **Find Patient with Highest and Lowest HbA1c Levels**
10. **Calculate Age of Patients in Years**
11. **Rank Patients by Blood Glucose Level within Gender Groups**
12. **Update Smoking History of Patients Older than 50 to "Ex-smoker"**
13. **Insert New Patient into Database with Sample Data**
14. **Delete Patients with Heart Disease from Database**
15. **Find Patients with Hypertension but Not Diabetes using EXCEPT Operator**
16. **Define Unique Constraint on "patient_id" Column**
17. **Create View Displaying Patient IDs, Ages, and BMI**
18. **Suggest Improvements in Database Schema to Reduce Data Redundancy and Improve Data Integrity**
19. **Explain How to Optimize Performance of SQL Queries on this Dataset**

## Dataset Information

The dataset contains detailed patient information, including demographic data, medical history, and various health metrics. It is essential to analyze this dataset to predict diabetes accurately and efficiently.

## Usage

These SQL queries can be executed on databases like BigQuery or MySQL to analyze the patient data and predict diabetes. Ensure proper database connectivity and access permissions before running the queries.
